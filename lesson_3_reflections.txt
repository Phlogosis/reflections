When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If you work in multiple locations, remotes become incredibly handy.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If Git auto-pulled, it could write over changes I was still working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones on Github. Clones are copies of commits. Branches are
  a series of commits. Forks are for basing work on others' work on Github.
  Clones are for making copies of files in order to make changes without 
  affecting the original. Branches are for experimental changes or changes
  that aren't necessarily part of the main commit.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    With both versions of the repository, any changes made by someone else
  can be cleanly merged.
